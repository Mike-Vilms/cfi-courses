## Defining Capital Markets
- The securities can be bought and sold on two types of markets:
  - The primary market is when a company directly issues the securities in exchange for capital.
  - The secondary market is when the security holders trade with other investors in a transaction that is separate from the issuing company.
- **Primary Market** or "New Issue Market" is where new securities are issued. This is a one-time event.
  - Corporation needs large amount of money for corporate purposes;
  - Investment Banks are in constant contact with corporations pithching financing ideas;
  - Corporations use investment Banks as a intermediaries to access investors looking to lend money;
  - After new securities originated, they are purchased by Institutional Investors in a primary market;
- **Secondary Markets** - where any tradign activity after new issue takes place. Only existing securities are offered. 
  - The corporation that issued original security is not involved;
  - After the money’s been invested, and securities are issued in exchange, investors can decide to sell their securities on the secondary market to other investors.
  - The transactions are facilitated either through a centralized exchange – such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) – or facilitated over-the-counter (OTC), which is a decentralized way of trading securities without a central exchange or broker.
- Participants in **Capital Markets** - Capital Markets institutions are grouped in "Sell Side" and "Buy Side":
  - **Sell Side** firms - Acting as an intermediary, investment banks are hired to facilitate deals between corporations and institutions. The job of investment banks is to connect institutional investors with corporionss, based on risk and return expectations, and investment styles. Careers in investment banking involve extensive financial modeling and valuation analysis.
    - Goldman Sachs
    - JP Morgan
    - Credit Suisse
    - HSBC
    - Morgan Stanley
  - **Buy Side**: Institutions consist of fund managers, institutional investors, and retail investors. These investment managers provide capital to corporations that need the money to grow and operate their businesses. In return for their capital, corporations issue debt or equity to the institutions in the forms of bond and shares, respectively. The exchange of capital and debt or equity completes the cycle of the two key players in the capital markets.
    - Bridgewater Associates
    - Blackstone

- Within the investment bank there are two major divisions: **Investment Banking Division (or IBD)** and **Capital Markets ( or Securities)**
  - **IBD**: is segmented in industry group coverage and product  
    - **Industry Group Coverage Teams** serve as relationship managers for large corporations seeking financial advisory services from the bank. They are **non-market facing (they do not directly deal with any sort of securities, debt or equity)**. Examples of **Industry Group Coverage Teams**
      - Financial Institutions
      - Real Estate
      - Telecom, Media and Tech (TMT)
      - Oil and Gas
      - Consumer and Retail
      - Healthcare
    - **Product Group**: is an industry agnostic group and focuses on **delivering one service across the insdustries**:
      - **Mergers and Aquisitions (M&A)**: they specifically offer one product: financiary advisory work on M&A-related activities across all industries; **it is the only IBD team that does this**;
      - **Origination** is nestled within Product Group as well; However, **unlike all IBD teams, the "Origination Group" deals with securities**; as a result, **they are the part of the "Capital Markets"**;
  - **CM Division**: has "Sales and Trading"(S&T) and "Research"
    - Within S&T there are several teams which are often called **"desks"** with each desk being dedicated to specific asset classes
    - Research is similar but slightly more broad

### Sell-Side Investment Banking: Originationa and Primary Markets
- Origination team acts as middle-man between issuers that need to raise a capital and institutional investors with access capital.
- Whole process of helping corporations to bring securities to market (issue securities) is called **"underwriting"**.
- Work of IBD team feeds the work for origination team; Team members in IBD unit are actively speaking with corporate clients to serve as financial advisors and win mandates like financing activities.
- **IBD team** mantains and manages overall relationship with clients and **origination team** are the ones that get the work done when clients decide whether they need debt or equity financing solutions.
- Both taeams act in **primary markets**.
- **DCM** underwrites debt: high-yeild bonds to investment-grade bonds
- **ECM** underwrites equity: common shares, preffered shares
- Full cycle:
  - There is an external client that wants to raise capital
  - This corporation (CFO/Treasurer) will reach out to an investment bank and make first contact with the managing director that leads the industry group that the corporation operates in
  - The IBD inits managing director and his/her team will listen to the client's needs and objectives and then put together a recommendation on what they believe is the most optimal
  - After presenting client's team with aalysis, the IBD team will reach out to peers in origination
  - After IBD team managing director approves, transaction will step into **Product Group**
  - The product experts will then take the client through every detail of securities issuing process until the client's securities can be sold into a primary market 
  - **Sales and Trading** will support the newly issued securities by trading them in the secondary markets

### Sell-Side S&T and Research: Secondary Market
- Parties that are involved in secondary markets: "Sales, Trading and Research", "Buy-Side"
- In addition to helping companies raise capital, the investment bank’s sales & trading arm facilitates and executes trades on behalf of institutional investors in the secondary markets, where the bank matches up institutional buyers and sellers.
- Together Sales, Trading and Research offer their clients value by **providing market liquidity**, **granting access to live markets insights from real-time trading data** and **publishing deep data analysis and insights on a regular basis**
  - Sales team acts as gatekeepers to the bank for institutional investors. They are referred as *client-facing*
