## Defining Capital Markets
- The securities can be bought and sold on two types of markets:
  - The primary market is when a company directly issues the securities in exchange for capital.
  - The secondary market is when the security holders trade with other investors in a transaction that is separate from the issuing company.
- **Primary Market** or "New Issue Market" is where new securities are issued. This is a one-time event.
  - Corporation needs large amount of money for corporate purposes;
  - Investment Banks are in constant contact with corporations pithching financing ideas;
  - Corporations use investment Banks as a intermediaries to access investors looking to lend money;
  - After new securities originated, they are purchased by Institutional Investors in a primary market;
- **Secondary Markets** - where any tradign activity after new issue takes place. Only existing securities are offered. 
  - The corporation that issued original security is not involved;
  - After the money’s been invested, and securities are issued in exchange, investors can decide to sell their securities on the secondary market to other investors.
  - The transactions are facilitated either through a centralized exchange – such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) – or facilitated over-the-counter (OTC), which is a decentralized way of trading securities without a central exchange or broker.
