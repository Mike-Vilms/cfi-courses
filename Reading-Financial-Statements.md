# Reading Financial Statements

- Balance Sheet represents a financial snapshot of the financial position of a company at a point in time
- Income Statement - or PNL - contains the transaction of a company for a period of time
- Statement of Cash Flows - shows  the opening cash balance of the company and then lists all of the transactions affecting cash to arrive at the closing cash balance.
  - Closing cash balance will match the balance reflected on the balance sheet 

## Balance Sheet
- Current vs. non-current:
  - Current Assets: Expected to be converted into cash in less than 1 year
    - Examples: Accounts receivables, inventory
  - Non-current Assets: Expected to be held greater than 1 year
    - Example: PPE
  - Current Liability: Will be paid in less than 1 year
    - Example: Trade accounts payable
  - Non-current Liability: Repayment terms longer than 1 year
    - Example: Loan repayable over a 5 year period

#### Investments
- A company will hold *external* investments for two reasons:
  - If it has *excess cash* that doesn't have a use for withing a very near term or
  - If it is accumulating cash to make a large purchase 
- Investments are either short term - when investments will be held for a less than a year - or long term - more than 1 year

#### Deferred Income Tax
- When a company prepares an income tax return, they use *tax rolls*. These are not always the same as *accounting rolls*. If the deduction is never allowed for tax purposes, then a permanent different (???) occures and no further work is required.
- If the deduction will be allowed in the future, then this is a "timig dufference" and teherefore recorded in the accounts
- For example, depreciation (or amortization) on a piece of equipment might be calculated using **straight-line method for accounting purposes**, however **for tax purposes an accelerated method is used**. Therefore, the amount of taxes owing will be different until the equipment is fully depreciated.
- The **difference between accounting income and taxable income is the basis for deffered income taxes**, also known as "future income taxes" and is recorded on the balance sheet 
- If there is less tax payables in the future - it is a asset. If there is more - then it is a liability

#### Goodwill
