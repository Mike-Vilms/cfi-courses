# Reading Financial Statements

- Balance Sheet represents a financial snapshot of the financial position of a company at a point in time
- Income Statement - or PNL - contains the transaction of a company for a period of time
- Statement of Cash Flows - shows  the opening cash balance of the company and then lists all of the transactions affecting cash to arrive at the closing cash balance.
  - Closing cash balance will match the balance reflected on the balance sheet 

## Balance Sheet
- Current vs. non-current:
  - Current Assets: Expected to be converted into cash in less than 1 year
    - Examples: Accounts receivables, inventory
  - Non-current Assets: Expected to be held greater than 1 year
    - Example: PPE
  - Current Liability: Will be paid in less than 1 year
    - Example: Trade accounts payable
  - Non-current Liability: Repayment terms longer than 1 year
    - Example: Loan repayable over a 5 year period

#### Investments
- A company will hold *external* investments for two reasons:
  - If it has *excess cash* that doesn't have a use for withing a very near term or
  - If it is accumulating cash to make a large purchase 
- Investments are either short term - when investments will be held for a less than a year - or long term - more than 1 year

#### Deferred Income Tax
- When a company prepares an income tax return, they use *tax rolls*. These are not always the same as *accounting rolls*. If the deduction is never allowed for tax purposes, then a permanent different (???) occures and no further work is required.
- If the deduction will be allowed in the future, then this is a "timig dufference" and teherefore recorded in the accounts
- For example, depreciation (or amortization) on a piece of equipment might be calculated using **straight-line method for accounting purposes**, however **for tax purposes an accelerated method is used**. Therefore, the amount of taxes owing will be different until the equipment is fully depreciated.
- The **difference between accounting income and taxable income is the basis for deffered income taxes**, also known as "future income taxes" and is recorded on the balance sheet 
- If there is less tax payables in the future - it is a asset. If there is more - then it is a liability

#### Goodwill
- If a company is purchased for more than the fair value of net assets(assets less liabilities), then the **difference between purchase price and fair value of net assets acquired** is recorded as goodwill
- It is considered as asset, because the reason for paying more for a company's physical assets is because of the intangible value of the company(brand, customers, intellectual capital) - these factors are considered to be benefits that will last longer then one year
- (!!!???) The value of goodwill is measured each year to determine if it is still appropriate. If not, it is written down to the amount considered to be a fair value

#### Intangible Assets
- Intangible assets are items of value that are used to generate revenues and have no physical substance
  - Coca-cola trademark design
  - Nike's
  - Patents for innovative product
  - Copyrights
 - They are subject to amortization
 
#### Unearned Revenue
 - Arises when a company sells something it has not yet delivered(???)
   -  Licenses
   -  Subscriptions
 - **Is a liability**
#### Commitments
- Future obligations that a company agrees to

#### Contingencies
- Liabilities that may or may not happen, depending on circumstance
  - Example: law suit

#### Common vs preferred shares
- Common shares - or common stock - allow for participation in the profits of the company - give right for one vote
- Preferred shares offer a fixed dividend (may not be paid annually) and paid before common share dividends are paid

#### Authorized and Outstanding Share Capital
- Authorized shares are the total amount of shares a company can sell
- Outstanding(Issued) shares are the total amount of shares a company has sold

#### Contributed Surplus
- Company issues shares with the par value - face value of the share. Excess amount that company recieves for stocks sold is referred as "Contributed Surplus"
